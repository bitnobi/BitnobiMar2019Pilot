# Software Evaluation Agreement

This Agreement is made as of the date hereof (the “Effective Date”) between BITNOBI INC., a corporation with offices located at 661 University Avenue, Suite 465 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (“Bitnobi”), and the person or entity identified as the licensee in the order form (the “Licensee”; each of Bitnobi and the Licensee, a “party”, and collectively, the “parties”) and sets forth the terms under which Bitnobi will provide the Licensee with the Program (as such term is defined below). 

The “Program” means (i) the “Bitnobi Version 1.0” software, together with any new versions or patches to the software developed by Bitnobi and provided by Bitnobi to Licensee (the “Software”); and (ii) any documentation, manuals, instructions, or other materials that Bitnobi makes available to the Licensee that describe the functionality, components, features, or requirements of the Software (the “Documentation”).  

The parties hereby agree as follows:

BITNOBI PROVIDES THE PROGRAM SOLELY ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND ON THE CONDITION THAT LICENSEE ACCEPTS AND COMPLIES WITH THEM. BY BY TYPING YES TO THE PROMPT "Do you agree to the terms in file License.txt?", (A) LICENSEE ACCEPTS THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREES THAT LICENSEE IS LEGALLY BOUND BY ITS TERMS; (B) IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE LICENSEE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT: (I) YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT; AND (II) YOU HAVE THE RIGHT, POWER AND AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE AND BIND LICENSEE TO ITS TERMS. IF LICENSEE DOES NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, BITNOBI WILL NOT AND DOES NOT LICENSE THE PROGRAM TO LICENSEE, AND LICENSEE MAY NOT INSTALL OR USE THE PROGRAM. 

### 1. Term 
This Agreement commences as of the Effective Date and shall expire 365 days after the Effective Date, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties or terminated in accordance with this Agreement (the “Term”). 
 
### 2. Authorized Users; Licensed Use of Software
“Authorized Users” means (i) any employees of the Licensee; (ii) any person (including a corporation, governmental organization, partnership, unincorporated organization, or other legal entity; but not including an individual acting on behalf of any of the aforementioned entities) to whom the Licensee grants access to the Program for the purpose of accessing or analyzing the Licensee’s data and that has agreed to be bound by the terms of the disclaimer set out in Appendix II to this Agreement (each an “Authorized Third Party”); and (iii) any employees of an Authorized Third Party to whom the Licensee grants access to the Program for the purpose of accessing or analyzing the Licensee’s data (any such employee or an Authorized Third Party, a “Third Party User”). 

Bitnobi grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable limited license to download, install and use, solely by and through its Authorized Users, the Program during the Term solely for the Purpose (as defined below) and in accordance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no Third Party User may download or install the Software without the express written consent of Bitnobi. The Program contains or embodies Confidential Information (as defined below) or trade secrets of Bitnobi, and Licensee agrees to treat the Program as Confidential Information as provided in this Agreement. 
The Software includes, integrates, or works with third party software (including open-source software) and other materials that are owned by persons other than Bitnobi and that are provided to Bitnobi on license terms that are in addition to and/or different from those contained in this Agreement (“Third Party Licenses”). Licensee is bound by and shall comply with, and shall cause the Authorized Users to comply with, all Third Party Licenses. A list of such Third Party Licenses, as of the date hereof, is set out in Appendix I to this Agreement. 

### 3. Licensee Responsibilities
Licensee agrees to provide (i) sufficient, free and safe access and a suitable physical and operating environment meeting Bitnobi’s specified requirements to permit the timely installation and safe operation of the Software on a server in accordance with Section 2; and (ii) adequate security to protect the Program from theft, damage, unauthorized access or misuse and to use reasonable care in the use of the Program. Licensee agrees that the Program will be used solely for evaluating the Software for the purposes of considering whether to enter into a paid software license agreement with Bitnobi (the “Purpose”). Licensee agrees that it will not, and shall require its Authorized Users not to, directly or indirectly, (i) install or use the Program for any use or purposes other than the Purpose; (ii) provide, lease, lend, use for timesharing, application service provider or service bureau purposes, or otherwise use or allow others to use the Program for their own benefit or for the benefit of third parties, except as provided hereunder; (iii) disassemble, reverse engineer, decompile, attempt to reconstruct, identify or discover any source code, underlying ideas, underlying interface techniques or algorithms of the Software by any means whatever or make any alterations or modifications to the Software without Bitnobi’s prior written consent; (iv) distribute in whole or in part, modify, or create derivatives of any part of the Program, except as provided hereunder; (v) move the Software to another location without Bitnobi’s prior written consent; (vi) transfer any interest in the Program or cause or permit any lien to be placed on the Program; (vii) copy, reproduce or duplicate the Program, by any means or in any manner, except as specifically permitted herein without Bitnobi’s prior written consent; (vii) use the Program in any manner not contemplated by Documentation provided by Bitnobi; (viii) use the Software to provide or otherwise disclose information (including personal information) to Third Party Users if such provision or disclosure of information is not in compliance with applicable laws, including the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act or the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 (Ontario), or if the Licensee or its Authorized Users do not have consent to provide or disclose such information; or (ix) use the Program in violation of any applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee is liable for all acts and omissions of Authorized Users, and any act or omission by Authorized Users that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if taken or failed to be taken by Licensee will be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Licensee. Licensee shall take reasonable efforts to make Authorized Users aware of this Agreement’s provisions as applicable to their use of the Program, and shall cause the Authorized Users to comply with such provisions. 
No license to use the Program or any other Bitnobi intellectual property is granted to Licensee except as explicitly provided in this Agreement.

### 4. Warranty Disclaimer; Support and Maintenance; Limitation of Liability; Indemnity; Fees
a) LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. BITNOBI EXPRESSLY EXCLUDES ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE PROGRAM, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM REMAINS WITH LICENSEE. 
b) IN NO EVENT WILL BITNOBI OR ANY BITNOBI PARTY (AS DEFINED BELOW) BE LIABLE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ITS SUBJECT MATTER UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY AND OTHERWISE, FOR ANY: (a) LOSS OF PRODUCTION, USE, BUSINESS, CONTRACTS, REVENUE, OR PROFIT; (b) BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR IMPAIRMENT; (c) ANY USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM; (d) LOSS, DAMAGE, CORRUPTION OR RECOVERY OF DATA, OR BREACH OF DATA OR SYSTEM SECURITY; OR (e) DIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, AGGRAVATED, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, IN EACH CASE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PERSONS WERE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES OR SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES WERE OTHERWISE FORESEEABLE AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY AGREED OR OTHER REMEDY OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
c) LICENSEE AGREES TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD BITNOBI AND ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS (EACH A “BITNOBI PARTY”) HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, JUDGMENTS, AWARDS, LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR FEES (INCLUDING REASONABLE LEGAL FEES) ARISING OUT OF, IN CONNECTION WITH, OR RELATING TO THE INSTALLATION OR USE OF THE PROGRAM BY THE LICENSEE OR AN AUTHORIZED USER OR THE BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY THE LICENSEE. 
d) Bitnobi will provide Licensee with training on the use of the Software. Bitnobi has no obligation to provide any other technical support. 
e) The Program is licensed at no charge to Licensee during the Term of this Agreement. As such, the warranty disclaimer and limitation of liability are a reasonable allocation of risk and the basis on which Bitnobi was prepared to enter into this Agreement.
f) Licensee shall ensure that any Authorized Third Party agrees to limitation of liability clauses in favour of Bitnobi and the Bitnobi Parties on terms at least as favourable to Bitnobi and the Bitnobi Parties as set out in Section 4b).

### 5. Intellectual Property Rights and Export Regulation
As between Bitnobi and Licensee, Bitnobi retains all intellectual property rights in the Program and all derivative works created using the Program, including copyright, trade-mark, patent and trade secret rights.  
The Software may be subject to Canadian or other export control laws. Licensee shall not, directly or indirectly, export, re-export or release the Software to, or make the Software or Documentation accessible from, any jurisdiction or country to which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, rule or regulation.
Licensee may provide Bitnobi with evaluation results, feedback, and ideas for enhancements resulting from or obtained during the evaluation authorized by this Agreement (“Results”). To the extent that any Results are provided to Bitnobi, Licensee hereby assigns all right, title and interest in the Results, and shall cause all Authorized Users to assign all right, title and interest in the Results, to Bitnobi. Bitnobi is free to use the Results, without any attribution or compensation to any other person. 
Licensee may not publish or disclose Results to a third party without the consent of Bitnobi, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

### 6. Confidentiality 
“Confidential Information” means all information of Bitnobi including the Program, methods and concepts used in the Program, the Documentation, any technical or business information of Bitnobi, marketing plans of Bitnobi, and any Results provided by the Licensee to Bitnobi.  However, “Confidential Information” does not include information which the Licensee can clearly establish: was lawfully known to or independently developed by the Licensee before being received from Bitnobi; has become available to the general public through no fault of the Licensee or its Authorized Users; or is lawfully obtained by the Licensee from a third party not having an obligation to maintain the confidence of the information.
The Licensee agrees that, except as provided in this Agreement, 
(i) it shall not disclose or make available the Confidential Information to any other person or entity;
(ii) it shall not copy or use for any other purpose other than set out in this Agreement, the Confidential Information;
(iii) it shall use the same degree of care (and no less than a reasonable degree of care) with respect to the Confidential Information that the Licensee employs with respect to its own Confidential Information.
Unauthorized disclosure or use by the Licensee of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to Bitnobi and result in significant commercial damages which may not adequately compensate for the breach.  In addition to any remedies that may be available at law, in equity or otherwise, the Licensee agrees that Bitnobi shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief enjoining the Licensee from engaging in any of the activities or practices which constitutes a breach of this Agreement.

### 7. Termination
Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice if the other party fails to meet any material obligations under this Agreement. Either party may terminate this Agreement for any reason by providing ten (10) days’ written notice to the other party.
Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) Licensee will immediately discontinue all use of and permanently erase or caused to be erased from the electronic systems and files of the Licensee and its Authorized Users all copies of the Software and any Confidential Information; and (ii) within 10 days after termination or expiration of this Agreement, return (or with Bitnobi’s written approval, destroy) and cause its Authorized Users to return all tangible documents or other materials that contain Confidential Information and provide confirmation in writing that it has complied with the requirements of this paragraph.
Bitnobi may activate and use a disabling device or encoded commands that prevent the Software from being used after termination or expiry of this Agreement. 

### 8. General
a) This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder may not be assigned, in whole or in part, by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, and any attempt to do so without such consent is void.  Neither party is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or portions thereof, is held to be invalid or unenforceable, it shall be severed and all other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.  
b) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to all the matters herein and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, letters of intent, negotiations and discussions between the parties, whether oral or written in respect thereof. Any changes to this Agreement must be made by mutual agreement in writing.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the applicable federal laws of Canada, and Licensee and Bitnobi agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the Province of Ontario to resolve any matter relating to this Agreement.

### 9. Survival

The rights and obligations of the parties set forth in this Section 9 and Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement, as well as any other terms which by their intent or meaning are intended to survive. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Licensee shall have no right to install or use the Program following expiration or termination of this Agreement.  No termination hereunder shall constitute a waiver of any rights or causes of action that a Party may have based upon events occurring prior to the termination or expiration date.
